// What's going to happen is our animal form is going to be passed into withFormik()(AnimalForm). When we call functions they often return a value. This is a function call that is returning a value. And that value is a component. We are going to capture that value in a variable. const formikAnimalForm = what we are returning, withFormik()(AnimalForm)
// Now we have a copy of animalForm called FormikAnimalForm but it now has extended logic thanks to the withFormik function. So important part to note is by calling withFormik, and passing in AnimalForm we are creating a brand new component that is a copy of AnimalForm.
// So now we have to export default FormikAnimalForm instead.
